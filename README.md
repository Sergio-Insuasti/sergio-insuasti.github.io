## About Me 📖  
I am currently exploring studying Bachelor of Economics/Computer Science (majors: AI, Econometrics and Big Data) at UNSW and am in my First Year!
I also have been a musician for a large part of my life! 🎵 🎻
I have degrees in Music Performance and Production from top schools in Sydney and London, and look to create more opportunities for musicians to embrace technology, particularly working complementary to AI. 🤖

## Learning Goals
I aim to develop a solid foundation in **programming and problem-solving** through hands-on learning and creative experimentation.
From this, I hope to averse myself in development and software engineering industries and apply my skills in either Economics or Computer Science.
