                <p><em>Ever grown tired of chasing your friends for money?</em></p>
                <p><em>Ever wished for one place to log all your split bills and expenses?</em></p></br>

                <p>
                    porshn is a simple app that splits bills and expenses across a group of users.</p>
                    By centralising users into private groups, all users can be:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Notified of New or Incoming bills</li>
                        <li>Assigned an equal (or custom) value of a bill</li>
                        <li>Assigned work to "pay off" bills</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
        </details>


        <details class="collapsible">
            <summary>Why It Matters</summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    As a university student, I can relate to the situation we face when a bill is on the table.</br>
                    Seeing as we are busy studying, we are often caught being unable to pay our fair share.</br>
                    porshn has been conceived to ensure that this doesn't have to be the case, with split bills being
                    easily sorted whether paid or incoming, in a social/group setting.
