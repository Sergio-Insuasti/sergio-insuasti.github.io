                    porshn is a simple app that splits bills and expenses across a group of users.
                    By centralising users into private groups, all users can be notified of new or incoming bills, 
                    equally assign upcoming or paid bills and delegate/rotate chores, and even extend to using chores as payment!

            <summary>Why It Matters</summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    As a university student, I can relate to the situation we face when a bill is on the table.</br>
                    Seeing as we are busy studying, we are often caught being unable to pay our fair share.</br>
                    porshn has been conceived to ensure that this doesn't have to be the case, with split bills being
                    easily sorted whether paid or incoming, in a social/group setting.
